# Restaurant QR Ordering & Payments Plan

This document outlines a staged approach for rolling out QR-code ordering and payment features within the Kontra platform.

## Phase 1 – Discovery & Planning
- Gather requirements for QR-pay, split-bill and digital menus.
- Identify PCI-DSS and data privacy obligations.
- Evaluate payment gateways that support QR sessions and SoftPOS.
- Sketch microservices for Menu, Order, Payment and Analytics modules.

## Phase 2 – Core Payment Engine
- Build API endpoint to generate signed, time-limited QR codes.
- Integrate a scanner/redirect flow for mobile users.
- Hook up to the chosen payment processor and handle webhook confirmations.

## Phase 3 – Digital Menu & Order Flow
- Admin UI for managing menu items and modifiers.
- Public menu display with an "add to order" cart.
- Endpoints to submit, modify and cancel orders with kitchen notifications.

## Phase 4 – Enhanced Billing
- Implement per-item or equal-share bill splitting.
- Generate payment links for SMS/email and support SoftPOS tap payments.

## Phase 5 – Analytics, Tips & Reviews
- Track metrics like average check and tip rates.
- Provide dashboards with real-time revenue data.
- Collect post-payment feedback and surface ratings in the portal.

## Phase 6 – Testing & Compliance
- Simulate scan-to-pay flows and refund scenarios.
- Run penetration tests to validate PCI controls.
- Stress test the system for peak load.

## Phase 7 – Deployment
- Pilot with a small set of restaurants and iterate on UX.
- Prepare onboarding docs, SDKs and support channels for a wider release.
